      <p>I would Like to give a special thanks to all of the other FLEX Abroad students in my cohort who have looked at this website over and over when I've asked them. Thank you to Drago»ô Stafiescu, my host brother, who got me into coding and helped me with suggestions for this website. Thank you to my host family and to the FLEX Abroad program and the United States Department of State and who made this program possible. It wouldn't have been possible without all of you who have been there and helped me along the way.</p>
